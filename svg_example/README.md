# svg_example

The app uses a container within a column to center the 
SVG picture in the view. The container fill is grey. The SVG image has a white background with colored rectangles 
in the center. A button at the bottom lets you start the animation.

This example uses a normal AnimationController for conventional Flutter animation. But once you have the SVG document
working you could change to a physics based animation and move the object around as desired. It could be used to create
a game. 

All the code is in lib/main.dart.
